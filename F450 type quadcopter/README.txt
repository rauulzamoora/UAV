This is another printable quadcopter (F450 type). Some parts are remake of existing ones with personal mods/improvements and some others are own design.

It flies really well, having less weight and flex than original DJI F450!

All parts shown on 3D drawings are printable parts (including cases!) and has been optimized for an easy and effective FDM printing.

... i will still adding/updating files to this thing as i design new mods/options/improvements, so stay tuned.

Print settings:
-Print on .STL position without supports (i use .25mm layer height). Print only parts you need (ie you want legs?, you want GPS?).

Legs types:
Legs are optional but recommended parts because they damp hard landings
There are different types:
The short legs are designed for using when nothing is installed under the bottom plate, the medium legs can be used when the battery is installed under bottom plate and the large ones when you install a large load under the bottom plate like a gimbal.

Print one part of each but:
-Arms: You need x4.
-Legs: You need x2 of typeA and x2 of typeB.
-APM2 damp: You need x2 pieces of dampBottom.

I use next infills with really good compromise between weight and strength:
-Arms: PLA 30% infill. I use M3 inserts of about 4mm OD and 4mm height pressed as threads (see pics and video).
-Legs: PLA 100% infill.
-Rest of parts: PLA 20% infill.

-For assembling use a bunch of M3x5mm and M3x8mm bolts and some M3 washers.

-My build weight without battery (including APM and basic FPV video gear) is only 815 grams.

-The camera i used is the microCamera with audio from here http://www.banggood.com/Eachine-700TVL-2_8mm-Lens-170-Degree-Wide-Angle-FPV-Camera-5-12V-p-992610.html

-The GPS case is designed for fitting this GPS http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:358329

Enjoy having a cool 3D printed quadcopter!
